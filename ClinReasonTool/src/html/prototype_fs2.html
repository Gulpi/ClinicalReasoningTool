<br/>
<div style="width:850px; float:left;"><br/> You and Dr. Carter greet Mr. Johnston and ask him the following questions:<br/>
"Tell me a little bit about this cough, did you have cold symptoms before the cough started?" <br/>
"Well actually I had a cough off and on for a few years. But it went away when I stopped smoking a couple of years ago. The cough I have now has been going on for a little over two months."<br/><br/>
"Did you have cold symptoms before the cough started?"<br/>"I didn't notice any cold symptoms at the start."<br/><br/>
"Have you had a runny nose or sore throat with the cough?"<br/>
 "No, nothing like that."<br/><br/>
"Have you been taking any medications, including the inhaler you have?" <br/>
   "Just using my inhaler like always."<br/><br/>
"Does anything seem to make the cough better or worse?"<br/>
"My inhaler helps a little, but I am still coughing quite a bit."<br/><br/>

"When you cough, do you bring anything up?" <br/>
"My girlfriend said I should come in because of the blood I've noticed sometimes when I cough. The blood comes up with a deep cough, and is sometimes mixed with mucous, and it seems to come and go."<br/><br/>

"Tell me a little more about the blood you are coughing up." <br/>
"It is maybe a half teaspoon once or twice a week of blood." <br/> <br/>
"Are you having any other symptoms, like shortness of breath?"<br/>
 "I've been able to work even with the cough, although I have not been able to climb stairs as quickly as usual as I've been too tired."<br/><br/>
"Have you had a fever?"<br/>  "No."<br/><br/>
"Have you lost weight?"<br/>
 "Not that I've noticed, but my girlfriend keeps mentioning that my pants are a little loose."<br/><br/>
"Have you ever been tested for tuberculosis?"<br/>
 "Not that I know of."
<br/><br/>

On review of systems, he has not had any chills, or chest pain, but he thinks he notices some wheezing occasionally.
